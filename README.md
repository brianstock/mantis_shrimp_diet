# Mantis Shrimp Diet

Data and code associated with:

> deVries MS, Stock BC, Christy JH, Goldsmith GR, and Dawson TE. 2016. Specialized morphology corresponds to a generalist diet: linking form and function in smashing mantis shrimp crustaceans. *Oecologia* 128(2): 429â€“442. [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-016-3667-5)

All mantis shrimp isotope data and R-scripts used to perform the analyses and create all figures are here. The best fit model (Habitat + source(Habitat) + concentration dependence) with an informative prior (hard-shelled prey 4x more likely than soft-bodied) is model #10, see `mixsiar_script_10.r`. The models using informative priors based on the prey abundance surveys are #s 13 (seagrass) and 14 (coral), see `mixsiar_script_13.r` and `mixsiar_script_14.r`.

The R code is based on MixSIAR (https://github.com/brianstock/MixSIAR), which requires you to first install JAGS (http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/). The code also depends on several R packages. Many thanks to the authors of:
